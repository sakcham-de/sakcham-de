## Hi there 
ğŸ‘‹ I am Shiva Timilsina, Master's student at Leibniz University. 
ğŸŒ± I am interested in computer vision, machine learning, positoning and localization.
ğŸŒ± I am currently learning problastic and non-problastic classifers along with self supervised learning
ğŸ”­ I am currently working on land cover classification using SWIN transformer for multimodal dataset
ğŸ’¬ You can ask me anything regarding computer vision and machine learning
